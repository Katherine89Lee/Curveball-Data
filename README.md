# Curveball-Data
An analysis on curveball pitches, the swings, misses, and other data.

The analyses in the Notebook in this repository started as just trying to grasp a basic understanding of the efficiency of curveball pitches. It evolved pretty quickly into curveballs vs fastballs, to further showcase the efficiency, whether good or bad.
The hope is to have a good, strong visualization by the end that will show that without too much confusion!
